when i was young i'd listen to the radio
waiting for my favorite songs
when they played i'd sing along
it made me smile
those were such happy times
and not so long ago
how i wonder where they'd gone
but they're back again just like a long lost friend
all the songs i love so well
every sha-la-la-la 
every wo-wo still shine
every shinga-linga-ling
that they're started to sing so fine
when they get to the part
where he's breaking her heart
it can really make me cry
just like before
it's yesterday once more
